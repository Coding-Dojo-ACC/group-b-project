                Gardeners are alchemists. They know how to turn crap into crops. To plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow. Nature never goes out of style. A garden is a friend you can visit anytime. Anyone who has time for drama is not gardening enough. Never underestimate the healing power of a quiet moment in the garden. Mother nature has the best box of crayons. Nature never goes out of style. Anyone who has time for drama is not gardening enough.
